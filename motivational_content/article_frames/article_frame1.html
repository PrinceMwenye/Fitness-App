        <h1>“I’m finally at peace with the way I look.”</h1>
    <p>Women’s Health recently shared the story of 27-year-old Krystal Sanders. Krystal’s unhealthy childhood eating habits followed her into adulthood, when the combination of a full-time job, nightly trips through the drive-through, and wedding-planning-related stressed added up to significant weight gain — and wedding photos Krystal couldn’t stand to share with others. This was her tipping point.</p>

    <p>In addition to committing to eating better, Krystal also started jogging on the treadmill and doing strength workouts. Not only did she shed more than 60 pounds through adopting these healthy behaviors, but she also saw her confidence skyrocket.</p>
        
    <p>Krystal has several tips for others on their own weight loss journeys, including setting out everything they need to work out in the morning the night before — from clothing to your water bottle. “Then,” she says, “Nothing can get in the way of your workout.” She also told Women’s Health, “Don’t be cardio all the time — lift weights! Replacing fat with muscle means you burn more calories without even trying.”</p>
