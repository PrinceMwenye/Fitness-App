      <h1>“It blows my mind when I think of all the physical activity I am now capable of that I was not even before I gained the weight.”</h1>
      <p>While active as a child, Suzi Walthall began putting on weight in her late teens and by the age of 38 had started binge eating. In the interim, she also gave up entirely on exercise. After reaching 460 pounds, she told Huffington Post, one day something snapped. She told herself, “I am not having anymore of this. This time, I will lose the weight, and it will be successful.”</p>
      <p>While even just walking a few blocks was a challenge for Suzi as she started an exercise program, she talked herself into joining the gym, where she began using Nautilus machines for strength-building. A major factor in helping Suzi reach her current weight of 180 was working alongside personal trainers who trained her in everything from traditional weight lifting to cardio kickboxing.</p>
      <p>She was so inspired by her personal trainers that she went on to become one herself. She says, “A lot of people who are not even as bad off as I once was often tell me they just cannot do what I have done, and I remind them of where I once was and how I pulled myself together.”</p>
