        <h1>1. This person who uses exercise to finally celebrate their body.</h1>

        <p>I'm transgender — female to male — and I spent 23 years haaaaaaaaaaating my body. Once I figured out I was a runner (another long journey), I started running marathons for fun! Now every race and recreational run is a celebration of the man I've become.</p>
