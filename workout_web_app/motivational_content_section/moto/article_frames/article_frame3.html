        <h1>“I LEARNED THAT WHEN YOU HIT A PLATEAU, IT MEANS THAT IT’S TIME TO SWITCH THINGS UP.”</h1>

        <p>While true weight loss success comes from within, sometimes an external nudge can be a major contributing factor. In Torrie Creamer’s case as reported in Everyday Health, that nudge came from her six-year-old son who asked her, “Mommy, why are you fat?”  This prompted Torrie to reflect on the reasons that had led her weight to climb to 322 pounds after getting married, having three kids, and working full-time, and to commit to stop making excuses and to start making change.</p>
        <p>Torrie started by joining a boot camp class, and while she initially struggled, support from the others in the class kept her going. She told Everyday Health, “I wanted to quit, but the support of the group kept me going. They became my family by not only being there for me physically, but also mentally when I felt challenged. When I realized they were not going to let me fail, I made a promise to myself to not let myself fail.”</p>
        <p>Torrie,  who lost a total of 149 pounds, is also open about her struggles with plateaus, and how she attributes that to complacency. She says, “To start seeing changes again, I would start eating differently or try a different style of working out.…I do cardio three days a week — usually CrossFit, boot camp, or Zumba. I also do weight training three days a week. I usually target different areas each day: chest/back/abs, shoulders/arms/abs, and legs.”</p>
        <p>life: “I can breathe! I can run! I’m not tired, and I can fit into clothes I never thought I could wear. I’m happier, and my relationship with my husband is better….The best thing is I’m able to inspire other women who have no confidence that they can lose weight, too. I love sharing my story and telling people I can relate to what they’re going through. It’s amazing to see them reach their goals!”</p>
        <p>If you’re like most people, you’ve probably found yourself wondering at one time or another how to gain some workout motivation. The next time you find yourself in a fitness rut, think of Krystal, Torrie, and Suzi for a solid dose of inspiration.</p>
